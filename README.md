## how to use
this is how **I had great success playing (pre-reforged versions)** across the atlantic:
1) have everyone in the same [`ZeroTier`](https://www.zerotier.com/) network.
2) choose one person to host and note their ZeroTier IP address.
3) all other players need to run [`WC3 Proxy`](https://github.com/leonardodino/wc3proxy) configured to the host IP.
4) everyone must use port `6113` on their game settings (`options` -> `gameplay` -> `game port`)

**troubleshooting**:
- the host should not run this utility (not sure if it impacts anything, but there's no need to)
- everyone should be on the same protocol version, and configure it on the proxy
- please use a stable connection, as there's no relay server between the nodes
