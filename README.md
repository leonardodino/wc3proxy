## how to play
**requirements**:
1) everyone has the exact same game version (numbers on the bottom right corner of the menu).
2) all players must set port `6112` on their game settings (**options** → **gameplay** → **game port**).
3) download this utility and [`ZeroTier`](https://www.zerotier.com/).

this is how **I had great success playing** on pre-reforged versions:
1) have everyone in the same [`ZeroTier`](https://www.zerotier.com/) network.
2) choose one person to host and note their ZeroTier IP address.
3) all other players need to run [`WC3 Proxy`](https://github.com/leonardodino/wc3proxy) configured to the host IP.

**troubleshooting**:
- the host should not run this utility (not sure if it impacts anything, but there's no need to)
- everyone should be on the same protocol version, and configure it on the proxy
- please use a stable connection, as there's no relay server between the nodes
